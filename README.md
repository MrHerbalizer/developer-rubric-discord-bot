# Developer Rubric Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot which allows you to assess your skills with our [developer rubric](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-rubric) directly on Discord. 

# Background

A rubric is simply a scoring tool that identifies the various criteria relevant to an assignment or learning outcome, and then explicitly states the possible levels of achievement along a continuum (poor to excellent or novice to expert). Rubrics can be used to assess almost any type of student work, be it essays, final projects, oral presentations, or theatrical performances. There are four types of rubrics viz. Analytics, Developemental, Holistic and Checklists. 

Sema's [Developer Rubric](https://github.com/Semalab/developer-rubric) is a Developemental type rubrics tool that you can use to measure your current place in your development journey.  
This tool is designed to answer the question as to what extent are students who engage in the programs/services are able to develop a certain skill/ability/value/etc.
